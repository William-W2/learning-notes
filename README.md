## 📘 Learning Notes

### Building complete projects instead of isolated features

Over the past few weeks, I focused on building **small but complete projects**
instead of isolated coding exercises.

Projects I worked on:
- Terminal Pac-Man (Python)
- Personal Dashboard (HTML / CSS / JavaScript)
- SQL Mini Online Store

Through these projects, I learned that **finishing and polishing a project**
is often more challenging — and more valuable — than writing individual features.

### Understanding real Git and GitHub workflows

Before these projects, I only knew basic Git commands.
While working on multiple repositories, I encountered real-world issues such as:
- Push rejections due to remote changes
- Inconsistent commit author names
- Rewriting commit history safely

Solving these problems helped me understand Git as a **tool for collaboration and history management**, not just version control.

---

### Writing code for readability and structure

As my projects grew, I realized the importance of:
- Clear project structure
- Meaningful variable and function names
- Separating concerns between logic, layout, and styles

This mindset shift was especially noticeable in the Personal Dashboard project,
where organizing CSS and JavaScript properly made future changes much easier.

---

### Documenting projects for others (and my future self)

Writing detailed READMEs forced me to think from the perspective of:
- A user running the project
- A reviewer scanning the repository
- My future self revisiting the code

I learned that **good documentation can significantly increase the perceived quality of a project**, even if the code itself is simple.

### Confidence gained from consistency

By pushing updates regularly and refining existing projects,
I gained confidence not only in coding, but also in:
- Planning tasks
- Debugging systematically
- Improving projects iteratively
